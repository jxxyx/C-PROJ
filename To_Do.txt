1. main.c, needs to be up by next meeting for the integration of the codes
2. Refine Database.c and Database.h
3. Can look to refine the hashmap to become list_Hash_Map, which is a structured 

TO DO:
1. Modify the database.c file to initialize a empty database.txt file.
2. Have the fileIO.h and fileIO.c to open and save the BaggageEzDB.txt
3. Create a menu to display declaration and show the open and save command
    - Users will be prompted to input accordingly.
    - Open leads to open file and allocate memeory and closing it afterwards
        > This will lead users to select the 5 functions
        > Users to choose what function to use (if...else)
    - Save file(Make the file rewrite over previous data and save the newest data)
4. Unit Testing(Saturday)
5. Error validation (Sunday)




Create a main function to ensure that there is a showall function done up, then run the codes to ensure that a type r file is created
Read and display all of the dataset within the Database
Ensure that the query function works 


Right now the ambiguity comes from the fact that all of the function does not read off of the Database that has  already been created
I will need to modify the codes to allow it to read off of my database.txt  file.
