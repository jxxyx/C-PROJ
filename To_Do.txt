1. main.c, needs to be up by next meeting for the integration of the codes
2. Refine Database.c and Database.h
3. Can look to refine the hashmap to become list_Hash_Map, which is a structured 

TO DO:
Create a main function to ensure that there is a showall function done up, then run the codes to ensure that a type r file is created
Read and display all of the dataset within the Database
Ensure that the query function works 


Right now the ambiguity comes from the fact that all of the function does not read off of the Database that has  already been created
I will need to modify the codes to allow it to read off of my database.txt  file.


Modify the database.c file to initialize a empty database.txt file.
